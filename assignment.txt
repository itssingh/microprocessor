Q.1. Initially B=05H, C=0H, A=0H, what will be the value at address 1004H after execution of the following code? 
   1. LXI H, 1000H
   2. MOV M, A
   3. INR A
   4. Loop: INX H
   5. MOV M, A
   6. DCX H
   7. ADD M
   8. INX H
   9. DCR B
   10. JNZ Loop
   11. HLT


1. 5                  B. 6                  C. 4                D. 3


Ans: D. 3
Explanation: In Loop subroutine A is moved to the current address in line 1.5. New value of A will be A=[HL]+[HL-1] which will be inserted to the next address after conditional jump.So after execution of the code values at address starting with 1000H will be {0,1,1,2,3,5}. Hence at 10004H value is 3.




Q.2. Initially A=19H, after incrementing A by 1 it has been rotated right circular twice. What will be the value in the A and Carry flag?
a. A=86H ,CF=1                    b. A=0DH, CF=0
c.   A=0DH, CF=1                  d. A=86H, CF=0


Ans: a. A=86H ,CF=1
Explanation: After increment, A= 1AH. A=00011010 on the first RRC LSB of A goes to CF and at MSB of A. So A= 00001101 and CF=0. 2nd RRC A=10000110 =86H and CF=1.


Q.3.  Choose the correct value in resistor C As soon as CF has set for the following code. Take N=10 and N=12. Initially: B=1, A= N and C=0.
1. LOOP:        SUB B
2.              INR C
3.              INR B
4.              INR B 
5.              JMP LOOP


A. C=3 for N=10 and C= 4 for N=12                  B. C=3 for N=10 and C= 3 for N=12
C. C=4 for N=10 and C= 4 for N=12                  D. C=4 for N=10 and C= 5 for N=12


Ans: B. C=3 for N=10 and C= 3 for N=12
Explanation: When loop is executed for nth time B= n2  which results in A=N-n2 and C=n. Carry flag will set in case of overflow i.e. n2>=N. So for N=10 to 15 when n=4 carry will be set after execution of code line 1 with C=3. Hence the given piece of code gives the square root of N.  



Q.4. Which of the following options is correct. Initially DE= 5H, B= 4H , C= 3H and HL= 00H.
        Loop1: DAD D
               DCR B
               JNZ Loop1
               XCHG
               LXI H, 0000H
               MOV B, C
               DCR C
               JZ Loop2
               JMP Loop1
        Loop2: HLT
        
1. Value of DE = 14H when instruction JMP LOOP1 executed for the first time.
2. Value of DE = 3AH when instruction JMP LOOP1 executed for the 2nd time.
3. Value of DE = 72H when instruction JMP LOOP1 executed for the 3rd time.
4. Value of DE = 76H when instruction JMP LOOP1 executed for the last time.


Ans: A. Value of DE = 14H when instruction JMP LOOP1 executed for the first time.
Explanation: When first XCHG is executed B=0, HL=5H and DE=4*5H=14H. Then B=3H and C=2H that mean in next JMP Loop1 DE<-HL=B*DE =3*(4*5H) and in next JMP Loop1 DE<-HL=2*(3*(4*5H)) unless C=0. So on final Jump DE=1(2*(3*(4*5H))).


Q.5 Interrupt RST_7.5 is called when a switch ‘s’ is closed. The output port is connected to a device which unlocks when the value stored at the address 7100H is 10. What’s the password of the device? 
            ORG 00H
            JMP MAIN
            MAIN: EI 
            LXI H,7100H
            MOV C, M
            LOOP: NOP
            JMP LOOP
            ORG 003CH
            RST_7.5:  MOV A,C
                      CMA
                      INR A
                      OUT CDH
                      EI
                      RET
            HLT


1. 155                b. 156                c. 246                 d. 256

Ans. C. 246
Explanation: When Interrupt arrives PC->ISR RST_7.5 with C= 10=AH. CMA results in A= F5H. INR A->A= F6H=246. So the password of the output device is option C.246.
