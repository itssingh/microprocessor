Microprocessor vs microcontroller: just cpu is microprocessor and cpu with other periferal devices like i/o port,RAM, 
ROM, timer, counter, Interrupt controller is microcontroller or microcomputer.
Counter vs timer: timer counts clockcycle whereas counter keep track of events.
word size: The processing capacity of ALU.(8-bit for 8085)
1 byte has two nibbles: lower and heigher
Machines code: Binary code that the processor understands.
Assembly code has Mnemonics. These are 3-4 letters english code. Assembly code has direct relationship with machine code. 
The biggest advantage of this is it is processor specific.
High level languages: It is converted to machine code using interpretor(python) or compiler(C/C++).
Control registers: Settings for the processor.
for selectively reset control register we use and operation.
ISR: Interrupt service routine; subroutine specially meant for interrupts.
EI: enable interrupt; two cases 1. when reset 2. when you come out of ISR.
NMI: non maskable interrupt (TRAP) 
HLT: compiler won't read beyond this point (STOP execution).It's a assembler director.
MMIO: memory mapped Input output (8085). IO is also mapped/ looks like memory address.
some addresses are mapped for memory and some addresses for address.
IN p: address bus is 16 bit in 8085 and p is a 8-bit address, generally address is split into two, 
lower address and higher address;so here p address is present for both Lower and higher order addresses. 
And only the lower byte helps in denoting a particular addresses.
LDA: load data into acc
LDAX B: compiler will go to address contained in BC register and load the value on that address to A.
