Microprocessor vs microcontroller: just cpu is microprocessor and cpu with other periferal devices like i/o port,RAM, 
ROM, timer, counter, Interrupt controller is microcontroller or microcomputer.
Counter vs timer: timer counts clockcycle whereas counter keep track of events.
word size: The processing capacity of ALU.(8-bit for 8085)
1 byte has two nibbles: lower and heigher
Machines code: Binary code that the processor understands.
Assembly code has Mnemonics. These are 3-4 letters english code. Assembly code has direct relationship with machine code. 
The biggest advantage of this is it is processor specific.
High level languages: It is converted to machine code using interpretor(python) or compiler(C/C++).
Control registers: Settings for the processor.
for selectively reset control register we use and operation.
ISR: Interrupt service routine; subroutine specially meant for interrupts.
EI: enable interrupt; two cases 1. when reset 2. when you come out of ISR.
NMI: non maskable interrupt (TRAP) 
HLT: compiler won't read beyond this point (STOP execution).It's a assembler director.
MMIO: memory mapped Input output (8085). IO is also mapped/ looks like memory address.
some addresses are mapped for memory and some addresses for address.
IN p: address bus is 16 bit in 8085 and p is a 8-bit address, generally address is split into two, 
lower address and higher address;so here p address is present for both Lower and higher order addresses. 
And only the lower byte helps in denoting a particular addresses.
LDA: load data into acc
LDAX B: compiler will go to address contained in BC register and load the value on that address to A.
LHLD a: put content present at a address to L and a++ addess in H.
NOP: No operations; for one machine cycle, buses and registers hold their value, they don't change.
Used to adjust timing, when we are working with slower periferal devices.
The main purpose of OR is to selectively set bits; AND helps you selectively reset bits.
OUT p: IN and OUT select the device present at p address and here A content is put in data bus and transfer to output device.
PSW: program status word: (A+Flags); PUSH PSW:A will be loaded at the higher address and flags at lower.
PUSH and POP: ISR and when running out of registers.
Machine cycle:time taken for one meaningful operation.
Buffer:for long interconnect,buffer boost the signal without changing it(copy). One input and one enable.
Two types inverter(Not with an enable) and buffer(back to back inverter;copy with boost the signal).
Three states in a buffer(0/1/Z).
